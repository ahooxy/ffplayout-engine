# Run ffplayout in container


## Base Image

Use of [CentOS image](https://hub.docker.com/_/centos) as base image as it offer the possibility to use systemd.
In order to run systemd in a container it has to run in privileged mode and bind to the `cgroup` of the host.

> **_NOTE:_**  A system with CGroup V2 is need!
> Currently tested host systems are:
> - debian 12 with official docker ce from docker.com
> - Manjaro from 2024 Kernel 6.6+
> - fedora 39 with podman

## Image

In addition to the base image, there is the compilation of ffmpeg and all lib from source based on https://github.com/jrottenberg/ffmpeg.
We can't use directly the image from `jrottenberg/ffmpeg` as it compile ffmpeg with the flag `--enable-small` that remove some part of the json from the ffprobe command.

The image is build with a default user/pass `admin/admin`.

You can take a look at the [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)

### /!\ as ffmpeg is compiled with `--enable-nonfree` don't push it to a public registry nor distribute the image /!\

## Storage

There are some folders/files that are important for ffplayout to work well such as:
 - **/usr/share/ffplayout/db** => where all the data for the `ffpapi` are stored (user/pass etc)
 - **/var/lib/ffplayout/tv-media** => where the media are stored by default (configurable)
 - **/var/lib/ffplayout/playlists** => where playlists are stored (configurable)
 - **/etc/ffplayout/ffplayout.yml** => the core config file

It may be useful to create/link volume for those folders/files.

## Docker

How to build the image:\
```BASH
# build default
docker build -t ffplayout-image .

# build from root folder, to copy local *.rpm package
docker build -f docker/Dockerfile -t ffplayout-image:alma .

# build ffmpeg from source
docker build -f fromSource.Dockerfile -t ffplayout-image:from-source .

# build with nvidia image for hardware support
docker build -f nvidia-centos7.Dockerfile -t ffplayout-image:nvidia .
```

example of command to start the container:

```BASH
docker run -it --name ffplayout --privileged -p 8787:8787 ffplayout-image

# run in daemon mode
docker run -d --name ffplayout --privileged -p 8787:8787 ffplayout-image

# run with docker-compose
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Note from CentOS docker hub page
There have been reports that if you're using an Ubuntu host, you will need to add `-v /tmp/$(mktemp -d):/run` to the mount.

## Kubernetes

basic example to run the service in k8s:
```
